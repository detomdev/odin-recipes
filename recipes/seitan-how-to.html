    <h2>What Is Seitan?</h2>
     <p>Seitan is the base for many commercially available vegetarian products such as Tofurky deli slices, meatless frankfurters, fakin' bacon, and others. You can generally find it in a variety of styles, such as ground, in slices, or in strips. Seitan can be prepared by hand using either whole wheat flour (which is a very labor-intensive process) or vital wheat gluten (which is a much simpler process). It is made by rinsing away the starch in the wheat dough, leaving just the high-protein gluten behind.</p>
    
    <h2>What Does It Taste Like?</h2>
     <p>Seitan has a savory taste, probably closest to bland chicken or a portobello mushroom. Seitan has a mild flavor on its own but can take on many more flavors from different recipes. It can be hot and spicy as in seitan "chicken wings " or savory in a succulent Indian or Thai massaman curry.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <h4>Seitan</h4>
    <ul>
    <li>1 cup vital wheat gluten</li>
    <li>1/4 cup nutritional yeast</li>
    <li>1 tsp garlic powder</li>
    <li>1 tsp onion powder</li>
    <li>1/2 tsp dried sage</li>
    <li>3/4 cup vegetable broth</li>
    <li>1 tbsp soy sauce</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Broth Mixture</h4>
    <ul>
    <li>2 cups vegetable broth</li>
    <li>2 cups water</li>
    <li>1 tbsp soy sauce</li>
    <li>1 tbsp maple syrup</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
    <li>In a mixing bowl, whisk the vital wheat gluten, nutritional yeast, and spices.</li>
    <li>Add the vegetable broth and soy sauce and mix until combined.</li>
    <li>Knead the mixture for a couple minutes until it becomes firm and stretchy.</li>        
    <li>Form into a rectangular patty that is about 3/4â€³ thick.</li>
    <li>In a saucepan, bring the ingredients for the broth to a boil.</li>
    <li>Place the seitan patty into the broth and bring the mixture to a simmer.</li>
    <li>Cover and allow to cook for about an hour, occasionally flipping. It will approximately double in size.</li>
    <li>Once it is done, allow the seitan to cool in the broth.</li>
</ol>

<p>Use this however you'd like! We recommend cutting it into thin slices and crisping each slice in an air fryer or in some oil on a frying pan. Enjoy these slices in a sandwich, dipped in some BBQ sauce, or any other way!</p>
